# Image Mixer

**Digital Signal Processing - Task 4**

## Overview

Image Mixer is a Python application developed for DSP Task 4, allowing users to blend multiple grayscale images using Fourier Transform components. The application provides an interactive GUI to select Fourier components (Magnitude, Phase, Real, Imaginary) from up to four input images, adjust their weights, and visualize the mixed result in real-time.

## Features

- **Load Multiple Images:** Import up to four grayscale images for mixing.
- **Fourier Components Selection:** Choose specific Fourier components from each image.
- **Weight Adjustment:** Assign weights to each selected component to control their influence in the mix.
- **Region Selection:** Apply inner or outer region masks with adjustable sizes to focus on specific frequency areas.
- **Real-time Visualization:** View original images, their Fourier components, and the mixed output.
- **Brightness & Contrast Control:** Adjust image brightness and contrast via mouse interactions.
- **Dark Theme:** A sleek dark-themed interface for better visual comfort.
